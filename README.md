|                           | Drive ESCs (e.g., BLHeli_32 35A)         |    2     | Electronic Speed Controllers for precise control of the drive motors.         |
| **‚öîÔ∏è Weapon System**      | Weapon Motor (e.g., DYS 5055 700KV)      |    1     | Powers the main weapon. Selected for high torque to get the weapon to speed.    |
|                           | Weapon ESC (e.g., Hobbywing FlyFun 80A)  |    1     | A robust ESC to handle the high current draw of the weapon motor.             |
|                           | Weapon (e.g., S7 Tool Steel Bar)         |    1     | The primary point of contact. Hardened S7 steel for impact resistance.        |
| **üõ°Ô∏è Chassis & Armor**    | Chassis Material (e.g., 6061 Aluminum)  |    1     | The main frame of the robot, housing all internal components.                 |
|                           | Armor Plating (e.g., AR500 Steel)        |    4     | Protects the robot's internals from opponent attacks.                         |
|                           | Fasteners (e.g., M3 & M4 Steel Screws)   |  ~50     | Holds the robot together under extreme stress.                                |
| **‚ö° Electronics & Control**| Battery (e.g., 4S 1500mAh LiPo)          |    1     | Powers the entire robot. 4S provides a good balance of voltage and weight.      |
|                           | Radio Receiver (e.g., FlySky FS-iA6B)    |    1     | Receives signals from the transmitter to control the robot.                   |
|                           | Radio Transmitter (e.g., FlySky FS-i6)   |    1     | The handheld remote control used to operate the robot during a match.         |
|                           | Power Switch (e.g., XT90-S Anti-Spark)   |    1     | Safely connects and disconnects battery power to the entire system.           |
|                           | Power Distribution Board (PDB)           |    1     | Distributes power from the battery to the various ESCs and electronics.       |

## Explanation of Hardware Categories ü§î

Each category of components serves a critical function in the robot's design and performance.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Drivetrain
The drivetrain is the robot's mobility system. It is responsible for all movement within the arena, including acceleration, turning, and positioning. A powerful and reliable drivetrain is crucial for outmaneuvering opponents and controlling the flow of the match. Our design uses two independent brushless motors, allowing for precise "tank-style" steering.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Weapon System
This is the primary offensive system of the robot. Its goal is to disable or destroy the opposing robot. The system consists of a high-torque motor to spin the weapon, a robust speed controller (ESC) to handle the power, and the weapon itself, which is designed for maximum impact and durability.

### üõ°Ô∏è Chassis & Armor
The chassis is the robot's skeleton, providing structural integrity and a mounting point for all other components. The armor is the robot's skin, designed to protect the vulnerable internals from the kinetic energy of opponent attacks. The choice of materials (like Aluminum for the frame and AR500 steel for armor) is a trade-off between weight, cost, and durability.

### ‚ö° Electronics & Control
This category represents the "brains" and "nervous system" of the robot.
*   **Battery:** The heart of the robot, providing the electrical power needed for all systems. We use a Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery for its high energy density.
*   **Radio System:** The radio transmitter and receiver form the communication link, allowing the driver to control the robot remotely.
*   **Power Control:** The power switch and distribution board ensure that power is managed safely and delivered efficiently to where it's needed.
