## Explanation of Hardware Categories ü§î

Each category of components serves a critical function in the robot's design and performance.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Drivetrain
The drivetrain is the robot's mobility system. It is responsible for all movement within the arena. A powerful and reliable drivetrain is crucial for outmaneuvering opponents. Our design uses two independent **brushed 550-size DC motors with gearboxes**, which provide excellent torque for pushing and precise "tank-style" steering.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Weapon System
This is the primary offensive system of the robot. Its goal is to disable or destroy the opposing robot. Our system features a **vertical drum spinner**, powered by its own high-torque DC motor. This design allows us to deliver powerful, focused hits and disrupt our opponents.

### üõ°Ô∏è Chassis & Armor
The chassis is the robot's skeleton, and the armor is its skin. Our robot is built around a **custom white steel chassis** for maximum rigidity. This frame is protected by **steel armor plates**, chosen for their durability and ability to withstand heavy impacts from other robots.

### ‚ö° Electronics & Control
This category represents the "brains" and "nervous system."
*   **Dual Battery System:** We use a dual-battery configuration: a large **5000mAh LiPo** for the high-demand drivetrain and a separate **1000mAh LiPo** for the weapon. This isolates the systems and prevents power sags to the drive motors when the weapon hits.
*   **Radio System:** The **FlySky FS-i6S** transmitter and receiver form the communication link, allowing the driver to control the robot remotely with precision.
*   **Power Control:** We use **brushed ESCs** to ensure smooth and responsive control over both the drive and weapon motors. Separate power switches for each system ensure safe operation.
